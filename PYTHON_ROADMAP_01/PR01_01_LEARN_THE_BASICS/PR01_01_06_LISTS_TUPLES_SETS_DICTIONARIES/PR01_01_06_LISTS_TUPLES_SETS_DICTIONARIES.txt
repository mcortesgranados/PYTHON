Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries are all data structures in Python, but they have different characteristics and are used for different purposes.

//_______________________________________________________________________
Lists:
//_______________________________________________________________________
Lists are ordered collections of items, meaning the order in which elements are added is maintained.
They are mutable, meaning you can change, add, and remove elements after the list has been created.
Lists are defined using square brackets [].
Example:
python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

//_______________________________________________________________________
Tuples:
//_______________________________________________________________________
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.
They are ordered collections like lists.
Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
Example:
python
Copy code
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

//_______________________________________________________________________
Sets:
//_______________________________________________________________________
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
They do not allow duplicate elements.
Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after creation.
Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
Example:
python
Copy code
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

//_______________________________________________________________________
Dictionaries:
//_______________________________________________________________________
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
They are unordered, meaning the order of elements is not guaranteed.
Keys within a dictionary must be unique, but the values can be duplicated.
Dictionaries are mutable.
Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {} and key-value pairs separated by colons :.
Example:
python
Copy code
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
In summary, the main differences between these data structures lie in their mutability, 
ordering, and uniqueness properties. Lists and dictionaries are mutable, meaning their contents 
can be changed after creation, while tuples and sets are immutable or mutable respectively. 
Lists and tuples are ordered, while sets and dictionaries are not. Sets do not allow duplicate elements, 
while dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys.
