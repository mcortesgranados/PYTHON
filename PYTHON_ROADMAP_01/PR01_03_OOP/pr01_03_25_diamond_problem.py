"""


The diamond problem is a common issue that arises in multiple inheritance when a subclass inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor.
This creates ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy, as the subclass may inherit duplicate attributes or methods from the common ancestor. 
Below is an example illustrating the diamond problem in Python, along with detailed explanations and documentation:

In this example:

- The Dog and Cat classes inherit from the Animal class.
- The DogCat class inherits from both the Dog and Cat classes, creating the diamond problem.
- When we attempt to create an instance of the DogCat class and call the speak method, it raises an AttributeError 
due to ambiguity in the method resolution order (MRO).

This example illustrates how the diamond problem in Python can lead to ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy, 
making it difficult to determine which method to call when there are duplicate attributes or methods inherited from common ancestors. 
To resolve the diamond problem, it's often necessary to use method resolution order (MRO) and carefully design the inheritance hierarchy.
