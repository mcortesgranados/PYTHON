# Example: Using Instance Attributes
# Let's demonstrate the usage of instance attributes by creating instances of the Car class.

# Create car objects
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
car2 = Car("Honda", "Accord")

# Access instance attributes
print("Car 1 Brand:", car1.brand)   # Output: Toyota
print("Car 2 Model:", car2.model)   # Output: Accord

# Describe cars using instance method
print(car1.describe())  # Output: The car is a Toyota Camry.
print(car2.describe())  # Output: The car is a Honda Accord.
