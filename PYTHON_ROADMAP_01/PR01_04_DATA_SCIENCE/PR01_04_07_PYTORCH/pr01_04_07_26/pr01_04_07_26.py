26. Implementing deep learning models for object detection tasks to locate and classify objects within images or videos.

Object detection tasks involve locating and classifying objects within images or videos. Deep learning models such as 
Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Faster R-CNN are commonly used for object detection. 
In this example, let's implement a simple object detection model using the Faster R-CNN architecture with a ResNet backbone 
in PyTorch and the COCO dataset for training.

In this example:

We define transformations for the COCO dataset, including converting images to tensors and normalizing pixel values.
We load the COCO dataset for object detection. The dataset is used for training the object detection model.
We define a data loader for training, which batches and shuffles the dataset.
We load a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet backbone from the torchvision model zoo.
We modify the model to have the correct number of classes for the COCO dataset.
We set the model to training mode and define an optimizer and learning rate scheduler.
We train the object detection model for a fixed number of epochs, iterating over batches of training data and updating the model parameters.

Finally, we save the trained model to a file for later use.

This example demonstrates how to implement a simple object detection model using the Faster R-CNN architecture with a ResNet backbone in 
PyTorch for training on the COCO dataset. In practice, more sophisticated architectures and larger datasets may be used for real-world object detection tasks.
