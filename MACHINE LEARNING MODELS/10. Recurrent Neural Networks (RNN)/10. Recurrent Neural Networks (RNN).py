# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed to effectively process sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward
#  neural networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. 
# This makes RNNs particularly suitable for tasks involving sequences, such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

# Here's a high-level overview of how RNNs work:

# Sequential Processing: RNNs process input data sequentially, one element at a time, while maintaining an internal state (memory) that captures 
# information from previous elements in the sequence.

# Recurrent Connections: RNNs have recurrent connections that allow information to persist over time. Each neuron in an RNN receives inputs not only 
# from the current input but also from its previous state.

# Shared Parameters: RNNs share the same set of parameters across all time steps, allowing them to efficiently handle sequences of varying lengths.

# Training: RNNs are typically trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT), a variant of the backpropagation algorithm that unfolds the network over
#  time and computes gradients by unrolling the network through each time step.

# Despite their effectiveness, traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies 
# in sequences. To address this issue, several variants of RNNs have been developed, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which incorporate specialized mechanisms for retaining and updating information over long time spans.

# In Python, you can implement RNNs using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Here's a simple example of how to create a basic RNN 
# using TensorFlow:

import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Generate dummy data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10, 1)  # Example: 100 samples, each with 10 time steps and 1 feature
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Binary classification labels
X_val = np.random.rand(20, 10, 1)  # Example validation data
y_val = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(20,))  # Example validation labels

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    SimpleRNN(32, input_shape=(10, 1)),  # 32 units in the RNN layer
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Evaluate the model on the validation data
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
print(f'Validation Loss: {loss}')
print(f'Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}')
